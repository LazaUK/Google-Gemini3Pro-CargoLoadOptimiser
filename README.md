# Van Load Optimisation by CLOA, powered by Gemini 3 Pro
**CLOA** (_Container Load Optimisation App_) is a 3D visualisation tool, designed to maximise the efficiency of cargo van loading. It simulates the placement of various standard parcel types into a fixed-size cargo van, generates real-time utilisation statistics and uses the _Gemini API_ to provide AI optimisation insights.

## Optimisation Challenge
This app is designed to assist with the load optimisation challenge, which requires efficient arrangement of a given set of defined items into a larger container.

The solution is currently tuned for a standard delivery vehicle:
- **Container Dimensions** (L x W x H): _3.0_ m x _1.8_ m x _1.9_ m.
- **Total Volume**: _10.26_ m^3.
